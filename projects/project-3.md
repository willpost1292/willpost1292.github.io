The Engineers for a sustainable World (ESW), an organization headed at Kapiolani Community college in Oahu, HI, designed and implemented an accurate wireless water monitor for the utility sink in the kitchen of 220 Grille, a restaurant located on KCC's campus. The water monitor is currently used to bring awareness to water consumption so the effectiveness of conservation efforts can be quantified.

The monitor was implemented using a Raspberry Pi and a water flow sensor. The monitor was installed on the end of a faucet in the kitchen of 220 Grille. A script was continuously recording the water used per second. The total water used per day was then calculated and sent to a web server, so that water usage can be monitored online. 


I was in charge of the software development. The majority of the scripts were written in Python, along with some shell scripts to manage updating the website and ensuring the water was always being recorded.
