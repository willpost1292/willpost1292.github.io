# Front-end Frameworks are your Friends

Anyone who has attempted to design a webpage can agree on one thing: HTML and CSS is painful. 
Spending mind numbing hours tweaking margins and padding is not appealing to most, especially to a programmer like me. 
Luckily, front-end frameworks like Semantic UI come to the rescue to help ease the pain. Although the learning curve can be 
somewhat steep, learning a framework is necessary to be able to quickly and cleanly express your project’s webpage.

So why learn a front-end web framework? Frameworks allow you to create without having to reinvent the wheel. 
As a developer, you shouldn’t waste time creating a nav-bar or a footer when it has been made a thousand times before. 
Frameworks also make your code more maintainable by reducing the amount of clutter in your HTML and CSS files. 

For the Software Engineering class I’m taking, we spent time learning the Semantic UI framework. Like it’s name implies, 
Semantic uses expressive language for it’s syntax which makes for a intuitive developer experience. Semantic favors simplicity
and functionality over flexibility, which means it lacks some of the bells and whistles that a framework like Bootstraps has, 
but is much easier to learn. This is perfect for a programmer like me who wants to spend as little time as possible on the 
front end of a project. 

It is important to note that it is still important to have the basics of HTML and CSS down before learning a front-end 
framework. While frameworks do a lot of the heavy lifting, knowing a good amount of HTML and CSS is necessary to give your 
website's a unique and personal touch. 

Learning a front-end framework may seem daunting, but it is worth it. The most powerful concept in computer science is 
abstraction. Frameworks abstracts away the pain of HTML and CSS so you can focus making an expressive website for your project.
