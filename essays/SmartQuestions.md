  Today’s software engineer cannot survive today without the help of online question-and-answer sites. These sites are 
  where millions of developers come together to answer each other’s questions. This not only helps individuals solve problems
  they are struggling with, but also help advance the developer community as a whole. It is crucial that the users of these
  forums ask questions follow certain guidelines in order to preserve the overall quality of the site. While Sites such as
  Stack Overflow have their own methods to promote these guidelines, It is the question askers responsibility to ask smart
  questions. This greatly increases the users chance of receiving a useful answer, and ensures that no one's time gets wasted. 


The article “How to ask questions the smart way”, written by Eric Raymond, describes in detail how to ask questions 
in a smart and appropriate manor. Some highlights from the article include:
*Make sure to exhaust all available means of answering the question yourself such as making a google search or reading the documentation
*Post questions in an appropriate forum
*Title questions in a meaningful and specific way
*Explain how you tried to solve your problem, the environment you were using, and other important details pertaining 
to your problem.

It is easy to spot smart and not smart questions on sites like Stack Overflow by the quality of the answers. 
Smart questions receive answers that are helpful and descriptive, while low quality questions are usually met with 
shortness and scorn. 

## Smart Question
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8547778/why-are-elementwise-additions-much-faster-in-separate-loops-than-in-a-combined-l"> Why are elementwise additions much faster in separate loops then in a combined loop?</a>

This particular question under the c++ forum was a very technical question that could not answered by any c++ documentation
or a simple google search. The question elicited a lot of interest, with most upvoted answer including a detailed
description of what was going on, test code, benchmark results, and benchmark graphs. Clearly the question was interesting
and asked in a smart way.

## Not so Smart Question
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32590751/make-this-script-work">Make This Script Work </a>

This question breaks many of the guidelines laid out in How to Ask Questions a Smart Way.
The question title is not detailed at all. The user is asking help on a homework assignment that is supposed to figure out
on his/her own. The user also could have easily found the answer with a simple google search. The question was included
the solution without a description, with the answerer joking that they were refraining from posting advice on how to ask 
for help.  

Public forums for posting and answering questions has been instrumental for the development of a strong software engineering community.
It is crucial that every new developer learns how to ask smart questions in order to both enrich the developer’s learning process and
keep public question-and-answer forums clean, helpful, and maintained.
