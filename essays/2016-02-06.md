  It was the summer of 2018, and I was looking at a mind numbing three months of waiting tables and cruising at the beach. As a computer science major, of course I had a list of new technologies I was gonna learn and projects I was gonna compete, but when school is out and the weather's nice, it’s hard to dive into a 2000+ page book on C++. My productive outlook this summer looked grim until one day, on a whim, I asked my manager, Joe, if he needed any programming work at all. As a matter of fact, he did. He was working on a web project for the restaurants and it’s sister restaurants. The project would be used to train new and existing employees. Concluding sentence.

  Joe and I started Ironing out the details of the site. The  project was gonna be bigger than I thought. Alot bigger. We’re talking an admin page, a database, dynamically generated html, the works. This lead to two realizations. First, we needed to use a solid web framework. We decided on the Django framework because I have a pretty solid understanding of the Python programming language, and Django seemed like a one stop shop as far as frameworks go. Second, I was gonna need help. My good friend Chris immediately came to mind. He was the hardest worker I knew, and a fast learner. There was only one issue. As a sophomore Electrical Engineering major, his programming skills was limited. But it’s like they say: “no time like the present to learn web development!”. We took a week to learn as much as we could about Django, Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and then embarked on a journey that would that teach us more about programming than any class we could ever take.
  
  Every step we took with this project was a learning experience. We poured countless hours working and learning about http requests, database design, caching, and way more. But while we were working, we had a strong guiding principles that we followed so that our project would be successful. One: Our project would correctly use version control via GitHub. Two: all features would be tested thoroughly before being pushed to the server. Three: We would code using good software practices, like not violating DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) and keeping things modular. Each one of these principles would end up being broken, the resulting pain was an invaluable learning lesson. 


## Correctly Using Version Control
